# Scheduled Ingestion Action

This sample code shows how to create a scheduled ingestion action using the Adobe Commerce integration starter kit. 
It provides an alternative to the event [ingestion webhook](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/starter-kit/events/#ingestion-webhook), practical when the third-party system cannot push events to the starter kit, and a pull mechanism from an event storage has to be used instead.

## Usage

After installation and configuration, the scheduled ingestion action will be triggered at the specified time.
