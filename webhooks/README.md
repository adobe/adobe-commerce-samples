# Webhooks Samples

This section contains a collection of samples that demonstrate the use of Webhooks in Adobe Commerce. 
Each application serves as a practical example of how Webhooks can be utilized to enhance the functionality and efficiency of your Adobe Commerce application.

## Overview

Webhooks enable developers to configure synchronous logic to execute calls to external systems when an Adobe Commerce event triggers. Synchronous calls are required when Commerce needs to immediately compute or validate something (order totals, taxes, payments) using a 3rd-party endpoint and write the result back into Adobe Commerce.

## Applications List

The applications covered in this section include:

- **add-to-cart-stock-validation**: Product add to cart stock validation.

Please refer to the README file of each individual application for more details.

## Getting Started

To get started with these applications, simply navigate to the directory of the application you are interested in and follow the instructions provided in its README file.

## Note

Please note that this section is still a **work in progress**. Application examples will be available soon.
